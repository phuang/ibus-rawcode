How to use ibus-rawcode

ibus-rawcode is very useful for developers, since they mostly work with codepoint instead of keyborad layout for testing characters
Also it will be very useful in case user want a particular character and it is not available on any keyboard input layout, and you want to use that

Just check for characters unicode value on http://www.unicode.org/charts/
and type directly that code using ibus-rawcode

example: U+0915 is code for à¤•
so if you want to input this character using ibus-rawcode directly type 0915 and you will get required output

ibus-rawcode presently not supporting utf8 encoding but in next version we will support that
also lookuptable now showing candidates from a to f, that is also planned for next versions.
